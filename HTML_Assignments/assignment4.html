    <p><em><strong>Virat Kohli </strong>(Hindi pronunciation: () born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and ODI cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain in all formats of the game, Kohli retired from the T20I format following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He's a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm medium bowler. Kohli is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, and is regarded by many as the greatest in the modern era. He holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and is second in the list of most international centuries scored.
        Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[5] He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic cricket.</em></p>
